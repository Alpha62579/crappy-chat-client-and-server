# crappy-chat-client-and-server
This is my first attempt at making a chat client in Python using the sockets library.

**Fair Warning: This is buggy and no part of the communication between the server and the client is encrypted.**

Here have a better chat application in Python [here.](https://github.com/topics/chatroom?l=python)

(P.S I can't even read the code that well at the end of the day)


If you end up trying to use this thing even after me telling this thing is buggy, make sure you set your server IP in a .env file with the key `HOST`. (client only)
Optionally, you can add another key named `PORT` if you want to use a port other than 62579 (client and host)
